				<h4>Colleagues need to connect, but sometimes away days seem disconnected.</h4>

				<p>What if exploring shared values as a team could be <strong>fun </strong> and <strong>purposeful</strong> at the same time? And no, I don‚Äôt mean volunteering to clean up the local park (although that‚Äôs a noble cause, but not an easy one to convince your team to embark on).</p>
				<h4>How about playing and making games for an hour, or an afternoon, or a day?</h4>
				<div class="image-frame">

				<h2>Why make games?</h2>

				<h4>Games are more than just fun.</h4>
				<p>They are a powerful medium because they let us step out of our (job) roles and immerse ourselves in a different world, with its own rules and roles. Unlike other media, as players we constantly make active choices: we shape the story, instead of just consuming it.</p>
				<p>Beyond solitary entertainment and power fantasies, games can make us think, help us learn and engage with complex questions, and problem-solve in a safe space where mistakes are free.</p>
				<p>Beyond zombies and space wars, we can play games about our reality. And we can makegames about how we want to transform our reality.</p>

				<h4>Making games promotes empathy</h4>
				<p>A game doesn‚Äôt exist without players. Imagine making a game for (or about) another team in your company. When designing it, you will really have to get into their shoes, understand their challenges and their goals, then turn your understanding into a playable activity.</p>

				<h4>Making games fosters deep conversations</h4>
				<p>A game doesn‚Äôt have a fixed outcome. When the outcome depends on the choices of all players, you will naturally start discussing ideas, weighing alternatives, and making decisions together. This is super-charged when you become the game makers. </p>

				<h4>Making games stimulates systems thinking</h4>
				<p>A game is abunch of rules. Rules defining how you can play, and rules describing how the game worldwill respond to you. When you are making the rules, you make that world. Whether the worldis your company, your industry or anything else, you will model it as a system, identifying its moving parts and exploring the behaviours of different actorswithin that system.</p>

				<h4>Making games gives teams agency and initiative</h4>
				<p>A game is a playable model of a complex system. When the system you are modeling is (part of) your business, the game becomes a tool for teams to explore ways to interrogate the system, and tweak how it works. Asking a lot of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions, designing and testing solutions which could be applied in the real world.</p>

				<h3>Why board games?</h3>

				<h4>Making board games can be quick and simple</h4>
				<p>In a board game, there is no software that gets in the way. You are the game engine. You constantly process rules and check that other players are not cheating. This means that making a new board game can be as simple as agreeing to new rules between players.</p>
				<p>You don‚Äôt need to know how to code. No need to worry about digital bugs. All you need is paper-prototyping material and a curious mind.</p>


				<h4>Making board games is collaborative</h4>
				<p>Instead of working on a computer (a device designed for a single human) when making a board game all team members can throw ideas on the table, move pieces around and think together.</p>

				<h4>A masterclass in creative collaboration</h4>
				<p>You will learn how to analyse, prototype, playtest and iterate a game idea. Not only will you <strong>practice collaboration</strong> with your team, you will also <strong>make a game</strong> <em>about</em> <strong>collaboration</strong>: your design challenge will be turning a competitive game into a cooperative one, where everyone wins or loses together.</p>

			<h4>A systems-thinking playful primer</h4>
			<p>The Swarm will teach you how to use games to <strong>facilitate conversations </strong> about something that interests you. By making a game about it, you will learn how to model it as a <em>system</em>, identify its moving parts and explore the behaviours of different actors within the system. </p>
			<p>The morning is about learning game-design while having fun. The afternoon is focusing on something that your team wants to solve while applying the skills you‚Äôve learned in the morning.</p>
