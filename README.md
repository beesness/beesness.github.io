# What if games were more than solitary entertainment or power fantasies?

I believe games can empower young people to engage with tough questions. Questions which are cloaked in fear and we're taught are too complex for us to answer, such as *How does our economy work?* or *What can we do to avoid running out of natural resources?* 

<!-- What can we do about climate change? -->

I want to create a safe space for kids to explore different actions and their consequences, learning about trade-offs and balancing for the greater good. For them to feel empowered to form their own opinions, because it's young people who are going to be the problem-solvers of the next 50 years!

# Who are you?

I am [Matteo](https://ma.tteo.me). 

Over the last 10 years, I've developed digital products for clients like the BBC, and lectured at universities around the UK. I love teaching people of all ages how to use technology to express their ideas.

I've had the privilege of teaching hundreds of people, but there was always a nagging question at the back of my mind. *How can I reach even more people? How can I facilitate a learning experience that doesn't require a teacher?* 

<!-- I want to create something **playful, meaningful and accessible**. Something that facilitates conversations between generations. -->

I’ve been flirting with the idea of making games since I was 11. I believe games can teach anything, and they’re especially good at making complex systems understandable. So I prototyped a game about the system of our times: *capitalism*.

# Introducing Beesness

**Beesness is a competitive / cooperative game for 2+ players that simulates a capitalist market economy**. 

A *beesness* is a business for bees. 

Not your usual bees. In this game, bees have learned how to do business from us humans: they can *trade* flowers for honey and honey for more bees, they can *extort* honey from other beesnesses and even employ *cheap labour*. 

You play the director of one beesness. You **compete** against other players over flowers (resources) and honey (money). 

Your beesness operates in the *garden of Commons*. If all flowers are taken from the garden, at any point during the game, everybody loses immediately! To avoid this tragedy, you can **cooperate** with the other players to replant flowers.

Will you manage to maximise your honey profits while avoiding *drone strikes* and a collective *beesaster*?

# Can I play it?

Yas! 

For now, you'll have to [print it yourself](). After you've played it, please get in touch and let me know how you found it [matteo@beesness.games](). One of your ideas may end up in the final game :)

I've been co-creating Beesness with primary and secondary school pupils. Many of the game features have been suggested, or even designed, by them!

# Can I buy it?

Not yet!

I'm planning a *Kickstorder* campaign. If you want to hear  when it launches, pop your email in the box below!
