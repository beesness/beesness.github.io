			<p>I believe games can empower young people to engage with tough questions. Questions which are cloaked in fear and we're taught are too complex for us to answer, such as <i>How does our economy work?</i> or <i>What can we do to avoid running out of natural resources?</i> </p>
			<p>I want to create a safe space for kids to explore different actions and their consequences, learning about trade-offs and balancing for the greater good. For them to feel empowered to form their own opinions, because it's young people who are going to be the problem-solvers of the next 50 years!</p>

			<h1>Hey there</h1>
			<p>I am <a target="_blank" href="https://ma.tteo.me">Matteo</a></p>
			<p>Over the last 10 years, I've developed digital products for clients like the BBC, and lectured at universities around the UK. I love teaching people of all ages how to use technology to express their ideas.</p>
			<p>I've had the privilege of teaching hundreds of people, but there was always a nagging question at the back of my mind. <i>How can I reach even more people? How can I facilitate a learning experience that doesn't require a teacher?</i> </p>
			<p>I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of making games since I was 11. I believe games can teach anything, and they‚Äôre especially good at making complex systems understandable.</p>
			<p>So I prototyped a game about the system of our times: <i>capitalism</i>.</p>

			<h1>This is <b>Beesness</b></h1>
			<p>It‚Äôs a game about <b>capitalist bees</b>!</p> 
			<p>You play as the CEO of a strange hive, where bees do business like humans.</p> 
			<p>Your mandate is to maximise <i>honey profits</i>, no matter what.</p>
			<p>Will you manage to grow your beesness and outperform your competitors, while avoiding environmental <i>beesaster</i>?</p>
			<!-- <p><b>Beesness is a game for 3-5 players that simulates a capitalist market economy.</b>. </p>
			<p>A <i>beesness</i> is a business for bees. </p>
			<p>Not your usual bees. In this game, bees have learned how to do business from us humans: they can <i>trade</i> flowers for honey and honey for more bees, they can <i>extort</i> honey from other beesnesses and even employ <i>cheap labour</i>. </p>
			<p>You play the director of one beesness. You <b>compete</b> against other players over flowers (resources) and honey (money). </p>
			<p>Your beesness operates in the <i>garden of Commons</i>. If all flowers are taken from the garden, at any point during the game, everybody loses immediately! To avoid this tragedy, you can <b>cooperate</b> with the other players to replant flowers.</p>
			<p>Will you manage to maximise your honey profits while avoiding <i>drone strikes</i> and a collective <i>beesaster</i>?</p>-->
